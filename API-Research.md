# API Research

## APIs
    * Maps APIs - "Collection" of several APIs including Solar, Air quality, Pollen, Street View, etc.
    * Google Login - Although there is no API, Google has a fast integration using OAuth 2.0.

## Maps APIs
    A comprehensive list of Maps' APIs can be found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform

    Listed below is a number of likely the most useful APIs for the project.
    
### Maps JavaScript API
    Customisable maps with our own content/imagery. Likely the core of APIs to be used. 

### Places Library, Maps JavaScript API
    "Up-to-date information about millions of locations". Could be useful for autofill typing, find place queries/requests.

    Allows for validation of addresses, i.e. suggest correction to a slightly incorrect address.

### Air Quality API
    Allows for request of air quality data for a specific location. Covers 100 countries with a resolution of 500x500 meters.

### Elevation API
    Elevation data for any given point in the world.

### Map Tiles API
    Allows for 3D/2D tiles, street view, satellite etc.

### Places API
    "Up-to-date information about millions of locations."

### Pollen API
    Can get pollen information including types, plants and indexes.

### Solar API
    Allows for in depth solar data, very elaborate
