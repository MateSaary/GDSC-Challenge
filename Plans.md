# Initial start

## Ideas
    * Solar panel api to show best coverage for maximizing solar energy gain + m^2 amount of panels required to gain energy
    * Central free education application, converging free content from the internet to maximize free education potential
    * Using air quality api to show red zones within an area, and calculate amount of trees required to lessen pollution + other functionalities
    * Using abuse experienced API to show redzones within an area showing people what to avoid in new areas

### Solar Panel project
    Frontend with login screen using firebase to contain user information, user enters address/location, google maps takes him to specific area, shows best coverage zones on rooftops and high areas for maximizing solar energy gain. User can select a specfic area and app will inform them of potential m^2 of solar panels required for greatest harvest. Weather API can inform user of best times for harvest, and slow cloudy days. possible expansion to using other apis such as air quality, soil quality etc.

### Free Education project
    cute and welcoming frontend with no login screen to maximize userbase from less fortunate regions, converging free sources such as freecodeacademy and youtube tutorials on different categories such as coding and business etc to enable all to educate themselves. potential login bonus to save/favourite certain sources and articles.

### Air Quality project
    Application in which the user can see red and orange zones indicating air quality within certain areas using the google api. In app calculation can be used to see how many trees are required within an area to reduce the pollution CO2 burden within the zone and bringing it from red -> orange or oragne -> green. Also can add additional functionality in which to show best living areas/ high smog areas etc etc. Possible expansions include adding donation button to spread coverage using donations to most needed areas with highest smog / high industrial action.
